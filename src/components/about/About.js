            Q: This is dumb. Why does it exist?
        </p>

            A: This <i>very</i> dumb website exists because I needed an idea for a web development bootcamp capstone project. Creative credit/blame goes to my friend Alistair, who shared the idea with me over beers a decade ago.   
        </p>
        <p>
            This project also exists as a nod to the early 2000s; a time when the internet still felt wide-open and websites didn't actually have to be "good" or "useful" or "make any sense" to be popular.  
        </p>

            Also there are probably people out there who need help deciding if things are yachts or not. This is for those people, too.
