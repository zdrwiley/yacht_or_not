            Why does this very dumb website exist?
        </h1>
        <p>
            That's an excellent question.

            This very dumb website exists because I needed an idea for a front end web development bootcamp capstone project. Creative credit goes to my friend Alistair, who explained the concept to me over drinks in Cambridge, MA a decade ago.

            This very dumb website also exists because I grew up on the early internet. I was 14 in 2001 when the original Hot-Or-Not.com launched. That site, which was also very stupid, became immensely popular and is said to have inspired the creation of Facebook. Facebook, of course, begat Instagram and LinkedIn and Snap and so on - culminating in the current nightmare of a commercialized attention economy that is the internet in 2021.

            Back in 2001, before all of that, the internet still felt wide-open. Anything was possible. The potential uses of the internet were apparent, but the technology hadn't matured sufficiently for many of the actually useful things the internet does today to be possible. As a result, websites didn't actually have to be good to be popular. It was enough for a site to simply make you laugh, or distract you, or give you something to AIM your middle school friends about.

            So this very dumb website is in part a throwback to the exciting dumbness of the early internet.
