            Q: This is dumb. Why does it exist?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A: This dumb website exists because I needed an idea for a front end web development course capstone project. Creative credit (blame?) goes to my friend Alistair, who shared the idea with me over beers a decade ago.   
        </p>
        <p>
            This very dumb website also exists because I grew up on the early internet. I was a teenager when the original Hot-Or-Not.com launched. That site (which was also extremely stupid) became immensely popular and to some extent inspired Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook and ruin the internet forever. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a nod to the time when the internet still felt wide-open, and websites didn't actually have to be "good" or "useful" or "make any sense" to be popular.  
        </p>

            Also, there are probably people out there who like deciding if things are yachts or not. This is definitely for those people, too.
